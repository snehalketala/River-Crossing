# River-Crossing
Farmer, wolf, goat and cabbage puzzle.
There is a farmer who wishes to cross a river but he is not alone. He also has a goat, a wolf, and a cabbage along with him. There is only one boat available which can support the farmer and either the goat, wolf or the cabbage. So at a time, the boat can have only two objects (farmer and one other).
But the problem is, if the goat and wolf are left alone (either in the boat or onshore), the wolf will eat the goat. Similarly, if the Goat and cabbage are left alone, then the goat will eat the cabbage.
The farmer wants to cross the river with all three of his belongings: goat, wolf, and cabbage.
